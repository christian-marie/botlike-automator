# The botlike automator

For creating interactive automations with multiple prompt based backends.

The idea is simple, you define automations in a DSL. That DSL is implemented
with native HipChat integration, along with a servant based API and CLI.

If hipchat dies, you have alternative implementations of the DSL, e.g.
web-forms.
